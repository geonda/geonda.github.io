Recently apple decided to move from old-friend bash to zsch. That's a good one.
Plenty of plugins, autocomplete on another level and custom themes for visual joy and productivity.

Just check it out:

- [install zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) and [iterm](https://www.iterm2.com)

- install oh-my-zsh (with curl):

 ` sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)" `

All setting now in `~/.zshrc` and the framework itself in `~/.oh-my-zsh`

- set up a theme for iterm [(powerlevel10 is supercool)](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
