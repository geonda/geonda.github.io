This package aims to create a convenient set of tools for analyzing experimental data and obtaining electron-phonon coupling values from phonon contribution to resonant inelastic X-ray scattering cross-section.

It currently includes:

- Model for 1D harmonic oscillator interacting with a single electronic level.
- Model for 2D harmonic oscillator (two modes active).
- Model for 1D harmonic oscillator, distorted and displaced in the excited state (excited-state potential energy surface (PES), differs from the ground state one).
